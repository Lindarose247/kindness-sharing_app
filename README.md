This project seeks to connects donors such as food banks , NGOs , privileged individuals with
recipients that lack food , helping to reduce wastage and improve accessibility of food to
everyone.
• The project was created to assist all those who are seeking food but have not been reached or
located by NGOs. It also gives a platform to anyone who want to share what they have at that
particular time that they have
• My personal focus was to build a meaningful project that will help solve a common project
withing my society, in this case being the eradication of starvation
Tell a story about yourself which relates to why you chose to work on this project
• I have previously worked for an NGO whose focus was the eradication of poverty. We donated
food to millions of disadvantaged people however we did not donate constantly, we probably
donated once or twice a year. I always wondered what happened to these families in the
months that we were not coming as the land they stayed in, could not produce food
.Therefore I felt the need to create an application where anyone who has something to share
can donate to somebody in need at any time. I also wanted to foster the spirit of sharing
amongst people , I wish people could just share whatever they have , instead of throwing it
away when they don’t want it

Summarize what you've accomplished with your project

Successfully built a web application for facilitating donations and connecting donors with recipients.
Implemented user registration and authentication functionalities using session based authentication, ensuring
secure access to the platform.
Integrated backend functionality using Flask, allowing for seamless communication between the frontend and
backend components.
Utilized React for frontend development, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
Implemented features such as food bank listings, donation submission, recipient requests, geolocation
integration, and a messaging system for efficient coordination.
Write about your most difficult technical challenge in depth
I had a challenge in understanding how to set up the Flask environment so that the HTML files are displayed
until we discovered the right way to put the files which is placing the HTML files in templates and the JS files in
scripts. I learned a lot about using Flask and MySQL which I was not familiar with before starting ALX.
Share what you've learned
Like I have mentioned above I learnt a lot about Flask and MySQL workbench, which I was not familiar with
before. If I were to do this again, I would collaborate with someone. What I have learnt about myself is that I
enjoy front end development as opposed to backend. This project has helped me choose my specialization as
a software engineer .this project has confirmed to me that frontend development is not that complicated .
Add a short paragraph about yourself after the concluding paragraph
I am a dedicated and passionate software engineering student with a strong desire to learn and grow in the
field of technology. I have a solid foundation in programming languages and concepts, allowing me to tackle
various software development challenges. Iam open for training and more learning
